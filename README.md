###Setting up the database:

1. Install PostgreSQL, and create a database named 'encompass'

      (in PostgreSQL) `CREATE DATABASE encompass;`
      
      (in PostgreSQL) Press `ctrl+D` to exit

2. In server/models/db.js, set variable 'resetDB' to true. This will wipe the database, and rebuild the tables.
3. In server/models/db.js, set variable 'seedDB' to true. This will add the seed data from seedData.json
4. Run server (nodemone server/server.js). Steps 2 and 3 will happen at server start.
5. Be sure to set the two variables back to false, otherwise 2 and 3 will happen everytime server is started.
